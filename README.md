# Installation

Save the two files in the same folder

# Use

open the folder where you saved dossier.bat and dossier.ps1 in CMD

from the folder, run the command

dossier "path/to/folder"

or

dossier path/to/folder

or

dossier

then paste the path/to/folder

# Bugs

If the path opens in the Windows explorer or is copied from Windows explorer, there should be no issue.
